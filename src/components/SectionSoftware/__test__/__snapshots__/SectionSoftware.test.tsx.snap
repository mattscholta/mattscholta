      I am actually pleasantly surprised how small this list is... These programs are at the 
      <b>
        core
      </b>
       of everything I do daily. While we can write code in in VIM or a text editor, life is just better with the right tools.

      Is my editor of choice and 
      <b>

       It 100% does everything I need it to and I am continuously impressed by the improvements I've seen to date.

      As far as terminal users go, I use it heavily every day. iTerm2 is free and full of features I use and many that I don't even know exist. Tabs, split-view, fast and reliable.

      At the core of the modern development workflow is üê≥ Docker. I can't begin to explain how enjoyable a great docker and docker-compose workflow can be.

      It's not that often that get to play designer but I do enjoy keeping up with the tools. Figma is available in the browser + app and fast, love it!
